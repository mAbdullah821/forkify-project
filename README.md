This project is a tool that allows users to search for and bookmark their favorite food recipes. It also allows users to customize their recipe searches by changing the quantity of ingredients based on the number of servings. Additionally, the tool provides a direct link to the actual recipe article for each search result. This tool was created to make it easier for people to find and cook delicious meals.
